# Contributing
Before contributing, here are some specifications and nitpicks we would like you to be aware of:

## The Basics
- it is recommended to use the `main` branch
- you must have Rust installed and be able to build rs-cord locally

## cargo fmt
Please format your code using `cargo fmt` before contributing. This ensures that code is legible.

## cargo check
Please check that your code properly compiles using `cargo check`. It must pass with zero errors and zero warnings.

If you would like to go an extra step, you can try doing `cargo build` to see if it builds locally.
Although `cargo check` will probably be enough.
